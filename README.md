## Encourage companies to contribute their developer time?
 cost of using OSS is giving back to the community.

Note:
There is a BoF on increasing contribution in OSS on Thursday at 11:45 AM


## Suggestions




## Get more reviewers




##  Need more documentation, video, audio, walking people through issues





## Drupal workflow is very unique and it doesn't apply to other OSS projects.





## Make sure that communications that happen in IRC are summarized and documented on issues





## Motivation?





## Time?





## Empathy
