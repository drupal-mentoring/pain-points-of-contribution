## What is contribution
<!-- .element: class="heading" -->

Note:
- Contribution is not necessarily just code contribution but contribution is
   organizing sprints,camps, meet ups, documentation, manual testing, design
   review, UX but here we are going to talk mainly about code contribution.




## IRC
Note:
- How many people in the audience use IRC? As you know that Drupal lives on IRC
and our day to day interaction occur in IRC related to issues in the issue queue
. For a new contributor, it is hard to know that there is an IRC unless someone
 tell them there is IRC channels that they can join and ask question/have
 discussion.




## How do I use IRC?
Note:
- Concern for many of the user is - How do I connect to IRC, what channels
 should I be in?



## Difficult to keep up on IRC
Note:
- There is no indication of "this" user is typing so there are 3 people talking
together and for example I am asking with someone else. All this get very
confusing.


## No scroll back
Note:
- There is no scroll back or history in IRC so if there was an interesting
conversation and if we aren't there then we don't know about it not that we want
to know but sometimes we do.


## Setting up bouncer costs money
Note:
 - Setting up bouncer costs money and it requires technical steps to set it up.
 Although it's easier later once you have set it up but initially it takes time
 money.

## Encourage companies to contribute their developer time?



## cost of using OSS is giving back to the community.

Note:
There is a BoF on increasing contribution in OSS on Thursday at 11:45 AM


## Suggestions




## Get more reviewers




##  Need more documentation, video, audio, walking people through issues





## Drupal workflow is very unique and it doesn't apply to other OSS projects.





## Make sure that communications that happen in IRC are summarized and documented on issues





## Motivation?





## Time?





## Empathy
