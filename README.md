## What is contribution
<!-- .element: class="heading" -->

Note:
- Contribution is not necessarily just code contribution but contribution is
   organizing sprints,camps, meet ups, documentation, manual testing, design
   review, UX but here we are going to talk mainly about code contribution.




## IRC
Note:
- How many people in the audience use IRC? As you know that Drupal lives on IRC
and our day to day interaction occur in IRC related to issues in the issue queue
. For a new contributor, it is hard to know that there is an IRC unless someone
 tell them there is IRC channels that they can join and ask question/have
 discussion.




## How do I use IRC?
drupal.org/irc
Note:
- Concern for many of the user is - How do I connect to IRC, what channels
 should I be in?
- supposed way to IRC channel for a new person: search for 'start contributing',
go to core mentoring page - go to IRC page



## Difficult to keep up on IRC
Note:
- There is no indication of "this" user is typing so there are 3 people talking
together and for example I am asking with someone else. All this get very
confusing.


## No scroll back/history
Note:
- There is no scroll back or history in IRC so if there was an interesting
conversation and if we aren't there then we don't know about it not that we want
to know but sometimes we do.


## Setting up bouncer costs money
Note:
 - Setting up bouncer costs money and it requires technical steps to set it up.
 Although it's easier later once you have set it up but initially it takes time
 money.
 What is a bouncer?




## Exploring Alternatives
drupal.org/node/2490332
Evaluate whether to replace drupal IRC channels with another communication medium
Note:
- Need an easier way to communicate?
Waartaa (OSS), Slack, Hipchat are some of the option being discussed in this
issue



## subscribe to issue notifications in email

<img src="custom/images/subscribe-core.png"  />
Note:
- We can subscribe to core issues and get email when there is a new comment made
on the issue or someone posted a new patch so that's one way to keep inform
about the changes.



## https://groups.drupal.org/core/updates
Note:
- alternative to IRC - core updates via email, also posted on drupal.org
already have Drupal core updates (a.k.a. "This Week in Drupal Core")
is a weekly-to-monthly update on all the cool happenings in Drupal 8!



## How do we recognize contribution?
drupal.org/node/2230579
Allow crediting reviewers (and other non-coders) as first-class contributors
Note:
- In this note, we are talking about categorizing comment as review
types -
Research - how things are done in Drupal, why it is broken and how other
projects accomplish something.
Proposal - If someone propose a idea or a specific architectural change
Patch - provide a solution or patch
Reviewers - Provide valuable reviews to the issue



## Doc review
Note:
- How do we give credits to reviewers reviewing docs? Use my example - I was
reviewing doc issue for one of the safemarkup issue and I said I reviewed the
doc and talked to contributor(who wrote the patch) in-person and I didn't get
commit credit. Why? Because I didn't say...yes, this line in this patch for this
function or method does exactly what it is supposed to do so even I read the
entire method and looked at the doc but failed to write that in the comment and
I ended up getting no credit after spending 2 hour on that issue.
SO in short provide a thorough feedback and not just that this works for me or I
applied the patch and it worked fine.

## Encourage companies to contribute their developer time?



## cost of using OSS is giving back to the community.

Note:
There is a BoF on increasing contribution in OSS on Thursday at 11:45 AM


## Suggestions




## Get more reviewers




##  Need more documentation, video, audio, walking people through issues





## Drupal workflow is very unique and it doesn't apply to other OSS projects.





## Make sure that communications that happen in IRC are summarized and documented on issues





## Motivation?





## Time?





## Empathy




## What other OSS projects are doing?
